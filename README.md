The hybrid framework seeks to achieve sentiment classification of fresh food review text and efficient extraction of product attribute topics. A classification model based on word2vec vectors is first implemented in combination with deep neural networks, and then attribute extraction is performed for the text. A combination of TF-IDF and word vectors are designed to extract the attributes in the topic extraction part. Finally, the hybrid framework is evaluated.
